                    All Indian classical dance forms since the ages have been developed not just as a mere mode of
                    entertainment but to enlighten the people to make them walk on the right path. By following the
                    trends of the
                    society, the changing tastesof the audience, and the social and cultural conditions of the places on
                    one hand
                    and also strictly adhering to the rules of the Shastrasas mentioned by the great sages on the other
                    hand, these
                    Classical
                    dance forms had a lot of transition and transformation over the ages.All art genres, majorly the
                    theatre and
                    dance drama forms have the primary responsibility to take on the problems that society is facing and
                    show ways
                    to end that by enlightenment. This is the crux of all our Epics, mythologies, and Puranas. This
                    paper throws
                    light on the deeds of the Kuchipudi Bhagavathulu to save the people from cruelty, as a social
                    responsibility.

                    Art, a combination of a diverse range of human activities, has a primary purpose of communicating
                    and
                    expressing the artist's feelings. But it is not just that. Art should also motivate and stimulate
                    emotions and
                    enlighten people to walk on the right path. Dance, the mother of all art forms (Curt Sachs, 1937),
                    can
                    communicate effectively and vigorously through all means. All art forms and most importantly the
                    theatre
                    forms have the primary responsibility to take on the problems that society is facing and to showcase
                    ways to
                    enlighten the public and boost their morale. The different narratives that would be performed by the
                    artists in
                    the dance dramas and theatre productions are always for the betterment of the lives of the people,
                    be it
                    philosophically, or spiritually. The mythological reason for the creation of Natya as mentioned in
                    the 1st chapter
                    (Natyothpathi) of the Natya Sastra of Bharata (Manmohan Ghosh, 1951) was for the betterment of the
                    lives of
                    the people and to teach them the path to act right (Dharma).The crux of all our Epics and Puranas is
                    also the
                    same. <br> <br>
                    Kuchipudi, one of the eight Indian Classical dance forms of India, that has its origins in the state
                    of Andhra
                    Pradesh, shares its name with the name of the village that it is believed to have originated from.
                    Kuchipudi is a
                    small hamlet in the Krishna District of Andhra Pradesh, 40 km away from the city of Vijayawada.
                    Kuchipudi
                    initially was performed by nomadic Brahmin men who danced the stories of Bhagavata Puranam, hence
                    called
                    “Bhagavathulu.” It was Siddendra Yogi, a 13th-centurysaint who taught his magnum opus the “Bhama
                    Kalapam” to the young Brahmin boys of the Kuchipudi village and has taken an oath that they would
                    practice
                    and preach this for generations(Swapnasundari, 2005).

                    According to the dance scholars of Andhra, the dance art flourished due to three dance traditions in
                    Andhra
                    namely, the Kakaparru, Mainampati, and Kuchipudi. The community that had migrated from Tamil Nadu in
                    the
                    11th century CE propagated the Kakaparru tradition in the coastal districts of Andhra which became
                    extinct
                    later. The Mainampati tradition that was prevalent in the Rayalaseema and the Nellore districts of
                    the now
                    Andhra Pradesh has also become extinct. The only surviving tradition that is still alive today is
                    the Kuchipudi
                    tradition which was started by the Brahmin men of that region and became world famous. Guru C.R.
                    Acharyulu
                    in his article “Andhra Natya Ounathyam” (Telugu) mentions that there are two types of dance
                    traditions in the
                    Andhra region, one being the dance drama tradition and the other being the solo tradition. He calls
                    the dance
                    drama tradition „Kuchipudi Bharata Natakam‟ and the solo tradition „Kuchipudi Bharata Natyam.‟ As
                    late as the
                    1960‟s Kuchipudi was still called the “KuchipudiBharatanatyam” which means the Bharatanatyam from
                    Kuchipudi village. Guru C. R. Acharyulu also mentions the different Bhagavathulu from the Andhra
                    region as
                    Palagudem Bhagavathulu (name of the village), SriramavaramBhagavathulu (name of the village),
                    Mylavaram
                    Bhagavathulu (name of the village), Yanadi Bhagavathulu (fishermen and hunters),
                    TummalapalliBhagavathulu
                    (name of the village), JangamBhagavathulu (bards and minstrels), Dasari Bhagavathulu (nomadic
                    groups),
                    ToorpuBhagavathulu (eastern coastal style), ChenchuBhagavathulu (tribal) all in different
                    presentations.
                    Kuchipudi Bhagavathulu were all Vaidikis and their profession is to learn and teach the Vedas,
                    participate in
                    religious rituals, and be trained professional priests. In addition to that profession as it was
                    instead of that in
                    later years, kuchipudi Brahmin men, young and old, became the votaries at the altar of the village
                    deities. Thus,
                    performance has become a professional and familial obligation, much revered and practiced. Such
                    family
                    performances have become hereditary from one generation to the other, thereby making it a
                    much-solicited
                    profession for the expert and a wage-earning prospect for many others.
                    <br> <br>
                    Amongst the various dramatic traditions that flourished in the Andhra region, the Yakshaganam
                    attained more
                    prominence. It is distinguished by its structure, musical features, and presentational format. This
                    genre has
                    influenced many group traditions which combined dance and drama in performance. The golden period
                    for the
                    Yakshaganam was during the rule of the Nayaka dynasty and more specifically during the reign of King
                    Vijaya
                    Raghava Nayaka (1633-1673 CE). Yakshaganam is a comprehensive form of art that contains various
                    components like Kalapam, Prabandham, Kuravanji, Veedhi Natakam, Bommalata, Harikatha, Marga Natakam,
                    etc., KuchipudiBhagavathulu performed many dance dramas based on the tenets of Yakshaganam. The
                    Brahmin
                    exponents of the art of Natya Mela shaped the form of Yakshaganam into a more stylized form
                    confirming the
                    tenets of Bharata‟s Natya Sastra. Being adept in the Vedas and Shastras and peripatetic preachers of
                    the art, they
                    gave a new life to Yakshaganam performances.
                    <br> <br>
                    Dr. Chinta Ramanatham, in his book “Kuchipudi Natya Visistatha” (Telugu) opines that Siddendra Yogi
                    belongs to the Kuchipudi village of the Divi Taluk near the Krishna River and he has taught the
                    Bhama
                    Kalapam to his native people. Siddendra Yogitaught this Bhama Kalapam to the young boys of the
                    Kuchipudi
                    village and took an oath from them that they would continue this tradition forever. Bhama Kalapam
                    has always
                    been the crowning glory of the Kuchipudi pantheon. With just three characters of Satyabhama, Sri
                    Krishna, and
                    Madhavi/Madhava, this „Sringara Prabandham‟ has swept the entire world with its presentational
                    style, Angika
                    and Vachika brilliance, and above all its deep philosophy of “Jeevatma striving to reach the
                    Paramatma”
                    concept.
                    <br> <br>
                    This Kalapam which flourished during a century before the Vijayanagara Empire has become the
                    traditional and
                    authentic form of Kuchipudi dance drama. This form achieved its classical character too. There is no
                    doubt that
                    there must have been commerce between the classical solo exposition, temple dances, and its various
                    exponents
                    in a climate so healthy for the growth of the performing arts. The two streams of solo exposition
                    and the dance
                    drama forms developed reaching their high watermark in the time of the Vijayanagara Empire, the
                    Augustan
                    period in the history of Andhra. Sri Krishnadeva Raya (r. 1509-1529 CE) composed the famous
                    “Amuktamalyada” in the Andhra Maha Vishnu Temple in Srikakulam village of Krishna district. History
                    tells
                    us that he has watched the Kuchipudi performances in Srikakulam and has used the word “bhrukumsa”
                    (which means a man donning a female role) in “Amuktamalyada.”
                    <br> <br>
                    Kuchipudi, the traditional dance form from the state of Andhra Pradesh, wasbread by the Kuchipudi
                    Bhagavathulu, the Kuchipudi dance drama tradition of Andhra had a deep influence from the Krishna
                    cult. The
                    first-ever documentation of the Kuchipudi Bhagavata performance was in the record named „Machupalli
                    Kaifiyat‟ that belonged to 1502 CE. Even in the records, the name of the troupe has been given as
                    „Kuchipudi‟
                    only and not any other terminology that has been going around according to some myths. The local
                    records
                    were collected on the instance of Surveyor General Mackenzie. According to the local records, a
                    troupe of
                    dance actors seems to have obtained an audience with Veera Narasimha Raya (r. 1505 - 1509 CE), the
                    ruler of
                    the Vijayanagara Empire. The Kuchipudi Bhagavathulu were on their way to the king's court when they
                    came to
                    know that one with the name Sammeta Guravaraju who was the local chieftain of a place named
                    „Siddhavatam‟
                    in the now Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, that was under the Vijayanagara empire tortured his
                    people
                    ruthlessly.

                    Sammeta Guravaraju used to torture his subjects for tax collection and in this process, he would
                    make the
                    women of the house suffer by plucking their breast nipples with iron hooks and pulling them onto the
                    streets.
                    KuchipudiBhagavathulu came to know about the barbaric punishments that the local chieftain was
                    giving and
                    decided to bring it to the notice of the King. As planned, they performed a Kelika in front of the
                    King and in
                    between smartly squeezed the episode of this suffering. One artist played the role of Sammeta
                    Guruvaraju, two
                    as women, and one as a servant. Since Kelika gives enough scope for improvising the altogether
                    unconnected
                    story of Guravaraju, the format would have been flexible. Some other scholars suggest that perhaps
                    the
                    Bhagavathulu performed a Pagati vesham since an alien story could have been incorporated into it,
                    for Pagati
                    Vesham is open ended, non-text-based presentation. But, P.S.R. Appa Rao, a scholar of Natya Sastra
                    and the
                    dance traditions of Andhra Pradesh, opines that the Bhagavathulu must have performed the Bhama
                    Kalapam.
                    But this does not seem valid because, in a Sringara Prabandham, one cannot incorporate violence. But
                    whatever
                    the presentation be and the debate on that, the king understood the situation and ordered to behead
                    Sammeta
                    Guravaraju. Impressed by their art and their social responsibility, Veera NarasimhaRaya donated some
                    lands to
                    them in the Rayalaseema area near present Cuddapah and Kurnool which were later wiped out by the
                    families
                    for personal reasons.This incident exemplifies how the Kuchipudi Bhagavathulu utilized their art
                    form not
                    merely for entertainment but as a medium for social commentary and reform. By addressing societal
                    issues
                    through dance and drama, they played a pivotal role in advocating for justice and highlighting the
                    transformative power of the performing arts in societal discourse.

                    Kuchipudi, as a classical dance tradition of India, has long transcended the boundaries of
                    performance art to
                    become a medium of cultural expression, spiritual communication, and social engagement. Its
                    historical
                    journey—from the temple precincts of Andhra Pradesh to global proscenium stages—reflects not only an
                    artistic evolution but also a deep-rooted commitment to social consciousness. Through its
                    narratives, characters,
                    and emotive storytelling, Kuchipudi has persistently echoed the concerns of the common people,
                    challenged
                    social hierarchies, and upheld moral and ethical values.
                    <br> <br>
                    As this paper has explored, Kuchipudi‟s integration of mythological themes with lived realities has
                    enabled it to
                    function as a powerful tool for dialogue, reform, and cultural continuity. The genre‟s inclusive
                    nature is also
                    evident in productions like Golla Kalapam, which speaks to its potential for voicing subaltern
                    identities and
                    critiquing systemic inequalities. Moreover, Kuchipudi's accessibility—through community
                    performances, street
                    plays, and educational outreach—has further strengthened its role in addressing social issues, from
                    gender
                    empowerment to ecological awareness.In the contemporary context, Kuchipudi continues to adapt and
                    respond
                    to the challenges of modern society.
                    <br> <br>
                    When performed in rural settings, schools, community halls, or even on digital platforms, Kuchipudi
                    becomes a
                    medium of outreach. It connects people to their cultural heritage while also opening up
                    conversations about
                    pressing issues. Thus, the dancer is no longer just an artist but also a cultural ambassador, a
                    storyteller, and a catalyst for awareness and change. In essence, the journey of Kuchipudi is
                    emblematic of the dynamic
                    relationship between art and society. It reminds us that classical traditions, when understood
                    deeply and applied
                    thoughtfully, do not remain relics of the past. Instead, they evolve into instruments of dialogue,
                    platforms for
                    the voiceless, and sanctuaries of collective memory and aspiration.
                    <br> <br>
                    It serves as a means of cultural preservation, youth engagement, and emotional healing, particularly
                    when
                    aligned with causes that seek to uplift marginalized communities. Dance, thus, becomes not only a
                    reflection of
                    societal values but also a force that can actively shape them.Ultimately, Kuchipudi stands as a
                    testament to the
                    enduring power of Indian classical arts to influence, inspire, and ignite change. As we move forward
                    in an
                    increasingly interconnected and complex world, revisiting and revitalizing such traditions with
                    purpose and
                    sensitivity can contribute meaningfully to collective well-being and cultural resilience.
                    Kuchipudi‟s footprints,
                    indeed, mark a path where beauty, devotion, and social good walk hand in hand.The footprints of
                    Kuchipudi in
                    history are not merely artistic—they are ethical, cultural, and deeply human. In walking that path,
                    we carry
                    forward a legacy where movement becomes message, and tradition becomes transformation.
