                </div>
                <div class="article-post">
                    <p>Beliefs are the foundation of our identity. They shape how we perceive the world and how we
                        respond to it. Formed through culture, relationships, media, and personal experiences, belief
                        systems guide us—but they also differ vastly from person to person, leading to inevitable
                        clashes of perspective.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Question of Binary:</strong> As Claude Lévi-Strauss noted, binary oppositions like
                        good vs. evil or tradition vs. change often drive narratives—and similarly, social discourse.
                        But real-life belief systems rarely fit neatly into categories of "right" or "wrong." For
                        instance, while advocating freedom of religion upholds individual rights, others may argue that
                        it challenges national cohesion. Both stances hold merit depending on context.</p>
                    <p>Yet beliefs don't exist in a vacuum—they influence actions, sometimes in harmful or extreme ways.
                        This is where accountability becomes essential. Forming a belief is natural and necessary, but
                        we must take responsibility when that belief affects others. Being accountable means
                        reevaluating our views, empathizing with differing opinions, and articulating our beliefs in
                        ways that promote understanding rather than division.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Question of Accountability:</strong> A modern metaphor for this appears in Inside Out
                        2 (2024), where the emotion Anxiety tries to replace Riley's core beliefs without justification.
                        Her lack of accountability leads to chaos, while balance and harmony return only when both
                        Anxiety and Joy acknowledge their biases and let Riley find her own way.</p>
                    <p>Education and law play vital roles here. Academic spaces allow exploration of diverse belief
                        systems and encourage critical thinking—valuing Chinua Achebe and Joseph Conrad in the same
                        breath. Similarly, laws adapt to evolving beliefs; the Mental Healthcare Act of 2017, for
                        example, decriminalized suicide in India, reflecting a shift in how mental health is understood.
                    </p>
                    <p>In conclusion, beliefs are powerful—they can change lives, shape societies, and rewrite
                        constitutions. But with this power comes the duty to justify, reflect on, and be responsible for
                        them. As Voltaire—and Spider-Man—remind us: "With great power comes great responsibility."</p>

                <div class="article-post">
                    <p>In 2023, a lifelong dream came true when I represented India as a Brand Ambassador for Indian
                        Culture at the G20 international event. The honor was humbling and unforgettable.</p>
                    <p>Taking part in the University Youth Challenge on Qualitative Research and Development Policy was
                        a proud milestone. But the true highlight was performing Kuchipudi—a classical Indian dance
                        that's close to my heart. On stage, I felt the power of cultural connection, using dance to
                        express India's spirit to the world</p>
                    <p>
                        Kuchipudi is more than art—it's a voice of heritage, rich in storytelling and emotion.
                        Performing it at a global platform reminded me of India's unique role in the world: a blend of
                        deep-rooted tradition and modern leadership.
                    </p>
                    <p>That moment under the spotlight made me realize the impact of culture in diplomacy. I walked away
                        not just with pride, but with a deeper commitment to keep sharing India's story—one performance
                        at a time.</p>

                    <p>I've always felt a deep urge to help girls and women better understand menstruation—a natural
                        process still surrounded by stigma in our society. This led me to Udanify, an organization that
                        empowers women by spreading awareness about menstrual hygiene and breaking taboos.</p>
                    <p>As a fundraiser, I support Udanify's mission to educate young girls through workshops that
                        provide accurate information and boost confidence. Many still face confusion and isolation due
                        to lack of resources and awareness, but our efforts aim to change that.</p>
                    <p>Udanify helps normalize conversations about periods and promotes dignity through knowledge. Being
                        part of this initiative has shown me the power of education and open dialogue. Every smile and
                        every breakthrough moment makes me proud to be part of this journey toward change.</p>

                    <p>By Shambhavi Sharma</p>
                </div>
                <div class="article-post">
                    <p>Lola came into my life when I was 14—a tiny toy poodle with soulful brown eyes who instantly
                        stole our hearts. From her first day, she became more than a pet; she became family.

                        Living with Lola is pure joy. She wakes me with nudges, races across the front yard with endless
                        energy, and plays hide-and-seek in the evenings. Her favorite spots at home—by my desk and near
                        the kitchen—remind us she's always nearby, waiting for a treat or simply offering comfort.</p>
                    <p>
                        Traveling with her is equally fun. She loves car rides, her head out the window, soaking in the
                        world with contagious excitement.
                        But one day, Lola went missing. Panic set in as we searched everywhere—through the neighborhood,
                        across shelters, online and offline. The house felt empty without her, and each night without
                        her soft sighs was agonizing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Days later, a call brought hope: someone in Ghaziabad had seen her. When we arrived and I saw
                        her again, joy overwhelmed me. Her excited leaps and kisses said everything—she was home again.
                        Her return filled our lives with warmth and love once more. Losing and finding Lola reminded me
                        of the depth of love and resilience. She's not just a part of my life—she is its heart.

                    <p>The rapid integration of automation and artificial intelligence is transforming industries and
                        societies worldwide. Traditional skills are becoming obsolete, creating both challenges and
                        opportunities. To remain relevant, workers must continuously learn and adapt to new roles that
                        demand modern skillsets.Sectors like manufacturing, healthcare, and IT are undergoing major
                        shifts, potentially displacing millions of jobs. According to McKinsey, 375 million workers may
                        lose jobs by 2030. Reskilling and aligning education with industry needs are essential for
                        economic survival.</p>
                    <p>Educational institutions must update curricula to enhance employability, emphasizing STEM fields,
                        emerging technologies, and soft skills like ethics, emotional intelligence, and critical
                        thinking. Careers in AI, data science, and coding are increasingly in demand.
                        Governments and educators are responding by integrating computational thinking and coding into
                        early education. India's NEP 2020 and Singapore's curriculum reforms are examples of
                        future-oriented policy. Unique human abilities such as empathy and problem-solving remain
                        crucial.</p>
                    <p>Teacher training, experiential learning, and adaptive platforms like BYJU's and Khan Academy can
                        support these reforms. Internships and real-world projects should be prioritized to prepare
                        students for dynamic careers.
                        Aligning education with evolving industry demands will improve employability, reduce
                        unemployment, and enhance global competitiveness. Governments, educators, and policymakers must
                        collaborate to build inclusive, future-ready education systems that ensure social and economic
                        stability in the age of AI.</p>

                    <p>In the past, most problems were local, but rapid transportation and communication have created a
                        globally connected world. The Covid-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of how quickly issues can
                        spread and affect lives and economies worldwide.Environmental health is deeply tied to human
                        health. Climate change, natural disasters, and
                        modern sedentary lifestyles contribute to global health problems that go beyond national
                        borders. These challenges require a holistic, interconnected response.</p>

                    <p>Global health efforts must include sustainable living, proper nutrition, exercise, and
                        preventive care—not just healthcare infrastructure. Youth-led climate action and global wellness
                        movements support this shift toward healthier lifestyles.India has made progress through
                        initiatives like Yoga Day, wellness organizations, and government
                        programs such as ICDS, midday meals, the Universal Immunisation Programme, and Ayushman Bharat.
                        These address malnutrition and healthcare access.
                    </p>
                    <p>Globally, organizations like GAVI and models from countries like Thailand and Delhi show the
                        impact of well-designed, inclusive healthcare systems. Shared global strategies, adapted
                        locally, are key to success.</p>
                    <p>Countries like Finland, Rwanda, and Japan show that preventive care, education, and community
                        engagement improve national health outcomes. Global health depends on many small, effective
                        actions working together.

                        Replicating successful models like Delhi's healthcare approach can help build a healthier, more
                        sustainable world for future generations.</p>
